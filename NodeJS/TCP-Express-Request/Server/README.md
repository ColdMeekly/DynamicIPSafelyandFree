# TCP Request IP Transmitter (Client)
This module uses Request to make a connection to the server, to update the IP.

## Setup
  - Extract this folder, and save it somewhere.
  - CD to that directory in a PowerShell or other Terminal.
  - Run `npm install`.

# Usage
Using it is very simple, and is only an example client.
  - Simply do `node app.js` in the same directory to run it.
If you see `Successfully updated IP Address of this machine!` then congratulations! The IP of this machine is on the server.

However, if you see an error then something went horribly wrong or you missed a step.

This is still work in progress, and many more features are to be created.
